excerpt: '<div style="text-align: justify">
Rodrik (2016) pointed out that late industrializing countries are experiencing a lower peak at lower income levels in the manufacturing employment share hump-shaped path. The present study develops a theoretical model to analyze the dynamics of industrialization and deindustrialization in developing countries and their integration with earlier industrialized economies. The findings suggest that financial development plays a crucial role in both accelerating industrialization and facilitating deindustrialization. Moreover, the model reveals that when developing countries integrate with economies in deindustrialization, the technological frontier in the manufacturing sector becomes relatively further ahead compared to the services sector. This discrepancy in technological proximity between sectors influences the differential productivity growth rates in manufacturing and services, driving an early shift towards the services sector. The model is calibrated to South African data from 1960 to 2010 and provides empirical support for these findings.

## I. Motivation

### • Deindustrialization is occurring along different peaks of the hump-shaped path of manufacturing employment share across countries, and these peaks occur at varying income levels
<div style="text-align: justify">
Figure I  below illustrates the evolution of employment share in manufacturing across different levels
of development and by region. It distinguishes between Asia (represented in blue), Latin America
(in green), and Africa (in dark red). We can see that the peak manufacturing share of African countries
is lower than that of Latin American countries, which, in turn, is lower than the peak share
in Asian countries. Furthermore, these peaks occur at sequentially lower levels of development,
underscoring the manifestations of premature deindustrialization across regions.

### • What does this paper do?
<div style="text-align: justify">
Numerous studies, including those by Sposi et al. (2021) and Huneeus & Rogerson (2023), propose that sector-biased productivity growth accounts for the patterns of deindustrialization observed across various countries. However, the question of why productivity growth is biased towards particular sectors remains unanswered. Initially, I demonstrate that financial development may influence the distribution of productivity growth across sectors and countries. Following this, I develop a three-sector endogenous growth model to investigate the effects of financial development on a country's structural transformation. In addition, I examine how integration with deindustrialized countries, facilitated through the process of technology adoption, can affect the share of the manufacturing sector.

## II. Model predictions
### • Finance and Structural Transformation
<div style="text-align: justify">
Figure II below exemplifies the impact of financial development on country' structural transformaton. During the industrialization phase, where the growth rate in agriculture ($g_a$) is greater than that in services ($g_s$), which in turn is greater than that in manufacturing ($g_m$), resources are primarily reallocated from the agricultural ($a$) and service ($s$) sectors to the manufacturing sector ($m$). This reallocation is further amplified by the level of financial development, favoring higher growth in the agricultural and service sectors.  Conversely, during the deindustrialization phase, where the growth rates satisfy $g_a>g_m>g_s$, resource reallocation is directed more towards the service sector. This shift is again amplified by the level of financial development.

### • Finance and Industrialization level
<div style="text-align: justify">
Figure III illustrates the
impact of financial development level on the sectoral share of consumption expenditure in manufacturing.
If an increase in financial development occurs before the peak of the manufacturing
sector share curve, the impact is positive. This signifies that during the industrialization phase,
enhanced financial development will support a higher inflow of resources into the manufacturing
sector.

  <strong>FIGURE III:</strong>  Effect of an increase in financial development at time $t_0$ on manufacturing share 
</p> 

<div style="text-align: justify">
However, if this increase occurs after the peak, implying a deindustrialization phase, higher
levels of financial development will instead spur the reallocation of resources from manufacturing
to services. At the same time, it will also cause a more significant exit from the agricultural sector,
thereby leading to a considerable influx into the manufacturing sector. The overall impact will
thus depend on the levels of entry and exit in the manufacturing sector, which are determined by
the differences in productivity growth rates across sectors.

## III. The model to data

  <strong>FIGURE IV:</strong>  Data vs Model
</p> 

<div style="text-align: justify">
 Overall, the model effectively replicates the observed pattern of structural change in South Africa from 1960 to 2010, despite some deviations in the magnitude of changes in employment share across sectors

  <strong>FIGURE V:</strong>  Impact of an incrase in the financial development on employement shares
</p>

<div style="text-align: justify">
Data from South Africa substantiates the theoretical model’s predictions. Increasing
the financial development level  decreases the agricultural employment share while the shares in the manufacturing and services sectors increase.
 </div>
 
### • Cross-country analysis
<div style="text-align: justify">
The cross-country analysis also shows that countries with a higher average level of financial development are those that have reached a higher peak.
