excerpt: '<div style="text-align: justify">
Traditional theories of structural transformation fail to account for the disparities between employment and value added shares, which poses a significant puzzle. In the case of South Korea, the value added share in manufacturing does not decline during later stages of development, unlike the employment share. To address this issue, I propose a Schumpeterian framework, incorporating technological innovation and trade at the sector level. This framework makes distinct predictions regarding employment and value added shares. In a closed economy, the model establishes an equilibrium where the share of value added equals the share of labor. However, when a country opens up to trade and achieves a monopoly through innovation in a specific sector (such as manufacturing in South Korea), it reduces its reliance on imported intermediate goods in that sector. As a result, the share of value added continues to rise while the share of labor declines.  </div>'
