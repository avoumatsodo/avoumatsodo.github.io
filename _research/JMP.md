excerpt: '<div style="text-align: justify">
I document notable differences in convergence speed across sectors and construct an endogenous growth model to elucidate the reasons behind these observed discrepancies. The model categorizes countries into three groups based on their levels of financial institutions and aggregate productivity. Initially, the first group, characterized by low aggregate productivity and weak financial institutions, experiences sectoral productivity divergence but eventually catches up with the second group. The second group demonstrates moderate levels of aggregate productivity and financial institutions, showcasing conditional convergence. On the other hand, the third group, characterized by high aggregate productivity and strong financial institutions, experiences unconditional convergence towards higher sectoral productivity. The model also suggests that convergence in sectors with faster growth rates at the technological frontier occurs at a later stage. Empirical evidence from the World Development Indicators dataset spanning 29 years and covering over 150 countries supports these and other predictions.

## I. Data

#### Across countries, intensity of use of adopted technologies is positively correlated with financial developement only for low financially developed countries.

### II. The share of manufacturing employment and the use of inputs in other sectors.

<div style="text-align: justify">
Figure II illustrates the relationship between manufacturing employment share and the use of manufacturing goods as intermediate inputs in other sectors from 1960 to 2010. The initial increase in both these measures until mid-1980s represents the growing prominence of manufacturing in the economy, largely driven by other sectors' increasing dependence on manufacturing products. However, post-1985, a noticeable decline in these indicators suggests a shift towards a service-oriented economy, and a reduced role of manufacturing. Structural changes, including alterations in production patterns and demand, have influenced these shifts over time.
