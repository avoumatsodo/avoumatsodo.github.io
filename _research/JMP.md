I document notable differences in convergence speed across sectors and construct an endogenous growth model to elucidate the reasons behind these observed discrepancies. The model categorizes countries into three groups based on their levels of financial institutions and aggregate productivity. Initially, the first group, characterized by low aggregate productivity and weak financial institutions, experiences sectoral productivity divergence but eventually catches up with the second group. The second group demonstrates moderate levels of aggregate productivity and financial institutions, showcasing conditional convergence. On the other hand, the third group, characterized by high aggregate productivity and strong financial institutions, experiences unconditional convergence towards higher sectoral productivity. The model also suggests that convergence in sectors with faster growth rates at the technological frontier occurs at a later stage. Empirical evidence from the World Development Indicators dataset spanning 29 years and covering over 150 countries supports these and other predictions.

## I. Motivation

### • Across countries, intensity of use of adopted technologies is positively correlated with financial development only for low financially developed countries.
<div style="text-align: justify">
Figure I  plots the average log of the total technologies per capita 
adopted per capita acros countries from 1980 to 2003 against the average level of financial development

</p> 


### • Sectoral proximity (in productivity) to the frontier is positively associated with more use of adopted technologies across countries
<div style="text-align: justify">
Figure II  displays scatter plots illustrating the association between the level of technology adoption
and the sectoral proximity to the United States

</p> 

### • What does this paper do?
<div style="text-align: justify">
 I construct a multisector growth model that features the above empirical facts observed in the data and show how  financial development and aggregate productivity determine convergence or divergence of countries at sector level. </div> 

## II. Model predictions
### • Finance and intensity of use of adopted technologies
<div style="text-align: justify">
Figure III below illustrates the intensity of technology use $\theta_{jt+1}$ of sector $j$ at time $t+1$ as a function of sectoral proximity to the frontier $a_{jt}$ at time $t$ in sector $j$. It indicates that as financial development increases, so too does the intensity of use of adopted technologies. However, this effect diminishes beyond a certain threshold of sectoral proximity to the frontier or level of financial development.

</p> 

### • Finance and Aggregate Productivity and Sectoral Convergence
<div style="text-align: justify">
Figure IV provides a representation of the distribution of countries based on their
levels of financial institutions $\kappa$ and aggregate productivity $A_t$. The three distinct groups of countries,
characterized by their convergence or divergence patterns, are clearly delineated in the figure. It
serves as a visual reference to better understand the relationships between financial development,
aggregate productivity, and the classification of countries into these distinct categories.
