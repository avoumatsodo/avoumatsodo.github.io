excerpt: '<div style="text-align: justify">
Traditional theories of structural transformation fail to explain the disparities between employment and value added shares. Buera and Kaboski (2009) consider this divergence to be a significant puzzle within the realm of structural transformation theories, particularly when examining multiple countries. Taking the specific case of South Korea into account, it is observed that the value added share in manufacturing does not decline in the later stages of development, unlike the employment share. To address this issue, I propose a Schumpeterian framework that incorporates technological innovation and trade at the sector level. </div>'
