excerpt: '<div style="text-align: justify">
Traditional theories of structural transformation fail to explain the disparities between employment and value added shares. Buera and Kaboski (2009) consider this divergence to be a significant puzzle within the realm of structural transformation theories, particularly when examining multiple countries. Taking the specific case of South Korea into account, it is observed that the value added share in manufacturing does not decline in the later stages of development, unlike the employment share. To address this issue, I propose a Schumpeterian framework that incorporates technological innovation and trade at the sector level. This framework allows for distinct predictions regarding employment and value added shares. In a closed economy, the model demonstrates an equilibrium where the share of value added equals the share of labor. However, I argue that when a country opens up to trade and establishes a monopoly through innovation in a specific sector (e.g., the manufacturing sector in South Korea's case), it reduces its reliance on imported intermediate goods in that sector. Consequently, the share of value added continues to rise even as the share of labor declines. This phenomenon is attributed to the increased innovation in manufacturing relative to other sectors, resulting in higher productivity growth in manufacturing. While this may have a negative impact on the labor share in manufacturing, it simultaneously boosts profits for the monopolistic innovator.</div>'
