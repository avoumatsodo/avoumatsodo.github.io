I document significant differences in the patterns of productivity convergence across key economic sectors and develop an endogenous growth model to explain these observed patterns. The model predicts that sectors with higher growth rates at the technological frontier, such as agriculture, will converge more slowly than those with lower frontier growth, like services. It also shows that the threshold level beyond which financial development no longer influences technology adoption varies by sector, with those closer to the frontier becoming unconstrained more quickly. Furthermore, the model categorizes countries into three groups based on their levels of financial development and GDP per capita, demonstrating divergent and conditional convergence for lower-income groups, and unconditional convergence for higher-income, financially developed countries. More importantly, as GDP per capita increases, leading to greater financing capacity, initially divergent sectors within a country can start to converge.

## I. Motivation

### • Across countries, intensity of use of adopted technologies is positively correlated with financial development only for low financially developed countries.
<div style="text-align: justify">
Figure I  plots the average log of the total technologies per capita 
adopted per capita acros countries from 1980 to 2003 against the average level of financial development

</p> 


### • Sectoral proximity (in productivity) to the frontier is positively associated with more use of adopted technologies across countries
<div style="text-align: justify">
Figure II  displays scatter plots illustrating the association between the level of technology adoption
and the sectoral proximity to the United States

### • What does this paper do?
<div style="text-align: justify">
 I construct a multisector growth model that features the above empirical facts observed in the data and show how  financial development and aggregate productivity determine convergence or divergence of countries at sector level. </div> 

## II. Model predictions
### • Finance and intensity of use of adopted technologies
<div style="text-align: justify">
Figure III below illustrates the intensity of technology use $\theta_{jt+1}$ of sector $j$ at time $t+1$ as a function of sectoral proximity to the frontier $a_{jt}$ at time $t$ in sector $j$. It indicates that as financial development increases, so too does the intensity of use of adopted technologies. However, this effect diminishes beyond a certain threshold of sectoral proximity to the frontier or level of financial development.

</p> 

### • Finance, Aggregate Productivity and Sectoral Convergence
<div style="text-align: justify">
Figure IV provides a representation of the distribution of countries based on their
levels of financial institutions $\kappa$ and aggregate productivity $A_t$. The three distinct groups of countries,
characterized by their convergence or divergence patterns, are clearly delineated in the figure. It
serves as a visual reference to better understand the relationships between financial development,
aggregate productivity, and the classification of countries into these distinct categories.
