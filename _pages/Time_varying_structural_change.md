<strong>Figure II<strong> illustrates the relationship between manufacturing employment share and the use of manufacturing goods as intermediate inputs in other sectors from 1960 to 2010. The initial increase in both these measures until mid-1980s represents the growing prominence of manufacturing in the economy, largely driven by other sectors' increasing dependence on manufacturing products. However, post-1985, a noticeable decline in these indicators suggests a shift towards a service-oriented economy, and a reduced role of manufacturing. Structural changes, including alterations in production patterns and demand, have influenced these shifts over time.
