<!-- [Financial Development, Globalization, and Industrialization]()
Abstract: 
<p align="justify"> 
  The present study develops a theoretical model to analyze the dynamics of industrialization and deindustrialization in developing countries and their integration with earlier industrialized economies. The findings suggest that financial development plays a crucial role in both accelerating industrialization and facilitating deindustrialization. Moreover, the model reveals that when developing countries integrate with economies in deindustrialization, the technological frontier in the manufacturing sector becomes relatively further ahead compared to the services sector. This discrepancy in technological proximity between sectors influences the differential productivity growth rates, driving an early shift towards the services sector. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of premature deindustrialization in developing countries in a globalized world, while highlighting the roles of financial development and sectoral proximity to the technological frontier.

  Time Varying Sectoral Inpout-Output Linkages and Structural Change (April 2023),  joint with [Isambert Leunga Noukwé](https://sites.google.com/view/isambertleunga/home)
Abstract: 
<p align="justify">  Intermediate-input intensities exhibit systematic variation with economic development across countries and over time. We have observed a significant disparity in input shares within all three sectors (agriculture, manufacturing, and services) for South Korea during the period from 1965 to 2014. This finding implies notable transformations in intersectoral dependencies throughout the analyzed timeframe. Such changes can be attributed to various factors, including technological advancements, shifts in production patterns, fluctuations in input prices, and evolving economic structures. By employing a three-sector, open-economy model of structural change, our objective is to elucidate how dissimilarities in input-output linkages contribute to the observed structural shifts in South Korea. </p>
