<!-- [Financial Development, Globalization, and Industrialization]()
Abstract: 
<p align="justify"> 
  The present study develops a theoretical model to analyze the dynamics of industrialization and deindustrialization in developing countries and their integration with earlier industrialized economies. The findings suggest that financial development plays a crucial role in both accelerating industrialization and facilitating deindustrialization. Moreover, the model reveals that when developing countries integrate with economies in deindustrialization, the technological frontier in the manufacturing sector becomes relatively further ahead compared to the services sector. This discrepancy in technological proximity between sectors influences the differential productivity growth rates, driving an early shift towards the services sector. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of premature deindustrialization in developing countries in a globalized world, while highlighting the roles of financial development and sectoral proximity to the technological frontier.

### [Time-Varying Sectoral Input Output Linkages and Structural Change](/sectoral-linkages-details/) (April 2023),  joint with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/isambertleunga/home" target="_blank">Isambert Leunga Noukwé</a>

 <summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abstract</summary>
<p align="justify">   We have documented a significant dynamic in input shares within all three sectors (agriculture, manufacturing, and services) for South Korea during the period from 1965 to 2014. This finding implies notable transformations in intersectoral dependencies throughout the analyzed timeframe. Such changes can be attributed to various factors, including technological advancements, shifts in production patterns, fluctuations in input prices, and evolving economic structures. By employing a three-sector, open-economy model of structural change, our objective is to elucidate how dissimilarities in input-output linkages contribute to the observed structural shifts in South Korea manufacturing employment shares. </p>

### Technology Adoption, Structural Change, and Biodiversity (May 2023), joint with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5MvX8VQAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Juha Siikamäki</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/matias-piaggio/home" target="_blank">Matías Piaggio</a>

 <summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abstract</summary>
<p align="justify">  This study examines the relationship between economic growth and biodiversity threat, aiming to provide insights for public policy decisions regarding structural economic system change for nature conservation. Using panel fixed effects estimation methods, this research aims to analyze data on the changes in aggregate extinction risk across species groups, technology adoption, and economic structural change. The primary focus of the statistical estimation results will be to project future changes in the risk of species extinction, specifically in the years 2050 and 2100, considering economic and population growth, as well as the potential impact of increasing protected areas coverage to mitigate these threats. The findings of this study will contribute to a deeper understanding of the intricate relationship between economic development and biodiversity conservation, ultimately facilitating enhanced comprehension of the synergies and trade-offs involved in achieving the objectives outlined in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</p>

### Innovation, International Trade, and Structural Change (December 2022)
 <details>
 <summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abstract</summary>
<p align="justify"> This paper develops an Schumpeterian endogenous general equilibrium model of stock asset pricing, linking R&D performance in diverse industries to asset returns. The model incorporates uncertainty related to innovation shocks aiming to explore the implications of R&D policies on asset price dynamics. By considering risk-averse agents and varying R&D investments, the paper demonstrates that R&D amounts and asset risk premiums differ across industries based on productivity levels.</p>
