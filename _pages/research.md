 <summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abstract</summary>
<p align="justify">   This paper documents  differences in productivity convergence patterns across key economic sectors and introduces an endogenous growth model to explain them. The model predicts that sectors with higher technological frontier growth, like agriculture, will converge more slowly than those with lower frontier growth, such as services. It also shows that aggregate divergence may transition to convergence as sectors catch up. As GDP per capita rises, even amid divergence, financial constraints ease, enabling lagging sectors to adopt more intensively technologies and accelerate productivity growth, reinforcing aggregate wealth and creating a positive feedback loop. </p>

 <summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abstract</summary>
<p align="justify">   Rodrik (2016) pointed out that late industrializing countries are experiencing a lower peak at lower income levels in the manufacturing employment share hump-shaped path. The present study develops a theoretical model to analyze the dynamics of industrialization and deindustrialization in developing countries and their integration with earlier industrialized economies. The findings suggest that financial development plays a crucial role in both accelerating industrialization and facilitating deindustrialization. Moreover, the model reveals that when developing countries integrate with economies in deindustrialization phase, the technological frontier in the manufacturing sector becomes relatively further ahead compared to the services sector. This discrepancy in technological proximity between sectors influences the differential productivity growth rates in manufacturing and services, driving an early shift towards the services sector. The model is calibrated to South African data from 1960 to 2010 and provides empirical support for these findings. </p>

<p align="justify"> 
Traditional theories of structural transformation fail to account for the disparities between employment and value added shares, which poses a significant puzzle. To address this issue, I propose a Schumpeterian framework, incorporating technological innovation and trade at the sector level. This framework makes distinct predictions regarding employment and value added shares. In a closed economy, the model establishes an equilibrium where the share of value added equals the share of employment. However, when a country opens up to trade and achieves a monopoly through innovation in a specific sector, it results in higher profits and greater value added relative to employment in that sector. Consequently, the share of value added increases more rapidly than the share of labor. Conversely, in sectors where the country lacks global monopolistic control, the share of value added diminishes due to lower profits for intermediate good producers, resulting in a value added share that is lower than the employment share. </p>
